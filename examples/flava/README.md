# FLAVA: A Foundational Language And Vision Alignment Model

## Abstract

State-of-the-art vision and vision-and-language models rely on large-scale visio-linguistic pretraining for obtaining good performance on a variety of downstream tasks. Generally, such models are often either cross-modal (contrastive) or multi-modal (with earlier fusion) but not both; and they often only target specific modalities or tasks. A promising direction would be to use a single holistic universal model, as a "foundation", that targets all modalities at once -- a true vision and language foundation model should be good at vision tasks, language tasks, and cross- and multi-modal vision and language tasks. We introduce FLAVA as such a model and demonstrate impressive performance on a wide range of 35 tasks spanning these target modalities.

## Training

### Setup repo

You should probably create a [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/index.html) environment before running the following step.

First, clone the repo, install `multimodal` and then install requirements for this project by using:

```
git clone https://github.com/facebookresearch/multimodal.git
cd multimodal
pip install -e .
cd examples
pip install -r flava/requirements.txt
```

### Get ImageNet

Get the ImageNet dataset's tar file by following the steps [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/aps/imagenet2012#dataset-summary) and set the path to ImageNet tar file by `export IMAGENET_TAR=/path/to/imagenet_object_localization_patched2019.tar.gz`. Rest of the datasets required for a debug run should be automatically downloaded on first launch.

### Launching and test pretraining

Launch your FLAVA debug pretraining job after making sure `IMAGENET_TAR` variable has been exported by running the following command:

```
python -m flava.train config=flava/configs/pretraining/debug.yaml
```

Note that:
- Running this command will take space on your disk. To change cache or other space options for HuggingFace datasets, please refer their [documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/cache).
- The first launch will take time as it extracts ImageNet, but later launches should be fast.

### Configuration

You can update the configuration by changing the config specified by `config` parameter or you can specify the parameters to be overridden by using a dotlist. For example, if you want to run the model with different numbers of training steps, you can do:

```
python train.py config=flava/configs/pretraining/debug.yaml training.lightning.max_steps=1000
```

Similarly, let's say you want to use a pretrained model for your pretraining/finetuning.

```
python -m flava.train config=configs/pretraining/debug.yaml model.pretrained_model_key=flava_full
```

### Full Pretraining

<TODO: Depends on addition of PMD which WIP>

### Finetuning

Similarly to pretraining, finetuning can be launched by following command:

```
python finetune.py config=configs/finetuning/qnli.yaml model.pretrained_model_key=flava_full
```

### Linear Probe
