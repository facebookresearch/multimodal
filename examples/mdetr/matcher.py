class HungarianMatcher(nn.Module):
    """This class computes an assignment between the targets and the predictions of the network.

    For efficiency reasons, the targets don't include the no_object. Because of this,
    in general, there are more predictions than targets. In this case, we do a 1-to-1
    matching of the best predictions, while the others are un-matched (and thus treated
    as non-objects). This implementation is based on the MDETR repo:
    https://github.com/ashkamath/mdetr/blob/main/models/matcher.py#L13

    Attributes:
        cost_class (float): Relative weight of the classification error in the
            matching cost. Default: ``1``
        cost_bbox (float): Relative weight of the L1 error of the bounding box
            coordinates in the matching cost. Default: ``1``
        cost_giou (float): Relative weight of the giou loss of the bounding box in
            the matching cost. Default: ``1``


    Args:
        pred_logits (Tensor): Classification logits.
            Size: (batch_size, num_queries, num_classes)
        pred_boxes (Tensor): Predicted box coordinates.
            Size: (batch_size, num_queries, 4)
        target_boxes_per_sample (List[Tensor]): A list of target bounding boxes.
            Length = batch_size.
            Each element is a tensor of size (n_boxes_for_sample, 4).
        positive_map (Tensor): :math:`\text{positive_map}[i,j] = 1` when box i maps to class j.
            Size: (total_boxes, num_classes) where total_boxes is the sum of
            n_boxes_for_sample over every sample in the batch.

    Returns:
        A list of size batch_size, containing tuples of ``(index_i, index_j)`` where:
            - ``index_i`` is the indices of the selected predictions (in order)
            - ``index_j`` is the indices of the corresponding selected targets
        For each batch element, it holds:
            len(index_i) = len(index_j) = min(num_queries, num_target_boxes)

    Raises:
        ValueError: If all costs are zero or first dim of target boxes and positive map
            don't match or classification cost and bbox cost shapes don't match.
